# 🚀 Itunu’s Automation Portfolio

Welcome!  
This is my personal collection of **automation projects** — built to help businesses, freelancers, and developers simplify work with smart workflows and code.

## 🧩 n8n Workflows
Automations created using [n8n.io](https://n8n.io), an open-source automation platform.

- [**Unsubscribe Manager for Lead Generation**](https://github.com/E2nuu/itunu-automation-portfolio/tree/main/n8n-workflows)
  Automatically detects unsubscribe replies in your Gmail outreach and updates Google Sheets to keep your lists clean.

- [**Error Notification Workflow (Slack + Gmail)**](https://github.com/E2nuu/itunu-automation-portfolio/tree/main/n8n-workflows/error-notifications)  
  Instantly alerts you in **Slack** and **Gmail** when any n8n workflow fails, including details like workflow name, failed node, error message, and execution link.  
  *(Perfect for teams who want to stay on top of automation errors in real time.)*
